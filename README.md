## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20.0.0
- npm

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Upload**: Users upload their web application's build folder (as a ZIP file)
2. **Process**: NimbusWave processes the files and uploads them to Cloudinary
3. **Deploy**: The application is deployed to Cloudflare's edge network
4. **Access**: Users receive a unique URL to access their deployed application

### Technical Implementation

- **Edge Network**: Utilizes Cloudflare Workers for serverless deployment
- **File Storage**: Cloudinary for static asset management
- **Frontend**: Built with Vite and React for optimal development experience
- **Backend**: Powered by Hono.js for efficient API handling
- **Zero Cold Starts**: Leverages Cloudflare's always-hot edge network

## 🧪 Development

```bash
# Run frontend
cd app
npm run dev

# Run backend
cd server
npm run dev
```
